### Benefit of Microsoft SSMS Storage.

# Methodology  

### Tools Used
- Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):
SSMS was primarily used as a data storage and management tool. A DirectQuery connection was established from Power BI Desktop to the SQL Server database, allowing real-time querying of essential tables (e.g., FactSales, DimChannel, DimProduct, DimGeography, etc.). This approach ensured data freshness and reduced duplication during analysis.

- Power BI Desktop:
The main tool for creating the data model, writing DAX measures, and building interactive reports. It served as the development environment for all dashboards and calculations.

- Power Query:
Used within Power BI Desktop for the ETL processâ€”cleaning, shaping, and transforming data after extraction via DirectQuery. Operations included column renaming, deleting unwanted columns, data type conversion, table joins, filtering, and calculated columns.

- Power Bi Service:
Dashboards were published to the Power BI Service for stakeholder access, real-time collaboration, and scheduled refresh management. The service also enabled dashboard sharing, mobile access, and usage monitoring.

- GitHub:
Used to host the documentation, project files (e.g., .pbix, .sql, .md), and provide public access for version control and portfolio presentation. It also served as a backup repository and platform to showcase the project in a professional setting.

### Development

General Approach to Creating the Solution:  

1. Project Planning & Requirement Gathering
2. Data Exploration & Profiling
3. Data Exploration & Profiling
4. ETL Process Using Power Query
5. Data Modelling
6. Measure Development Using DAX
7. Dashboard Design & Visualization
8. Publishing and Collaboration
9. Documentation & Version Control
10. Review & Iteration

#### Project Planning & Requirement Gathering

- Defined project scope and objectives (e.g., analyse sales channel performance,  product profitability, and geographical and sales trends).
- Identified key stakeholders (Sales, Marketing, and Executives) and gathered reporting requirements and KPIs.  
#### Data Source Setup and Access  

- Microsoft SQL Server was used to host the primary Contoso dataset.
- Connected Power BI Desktop to SQL Server using DirectQuery to enable real-time data access.
- Identified and extracted essential tables such as FactSales, DimChannel, DimProduct, DimGeography, and Date.

#### Data Exploration & Profiling  

- Reviewed data structures, row volumes, null values, duplicates, and relationships.
- Verified foreign key integrity across fact and dimension tables.
- Identified the appropriate grain of analysis (e.g., sales transactions per channel, date, and product).

#### ETL Process Using Power Query  

- Cleaned and transformed data using Power Query within Power BI Desktop.
- Applied business rules such as standardizing product labels, calculating derived columns (e.g., ROI, Net Sales), and removing unnecessary fields.
- Joined related tables for initial dimensional shaping.

#### Data Modelling  

- Built a star schema by establishing relationships between the fact table (FactSales) and relevant dimension tables.
- Ensured appropriate cardinality (e.g., many-to-one) and cross-filter directions.
- Added a dynamic date dimension for robust time intelligence.

![Contoso semantic model](Assets_Folder/Images/Contoso_semantic_model.png)

From the above Power BI data model pane image above we can see that a many to one (*:1) was establish between the FactSales  (The Fact Table) and Dimensions Table (Product, Customer, and date table).The other tables shown are the Dax measure and measure documentation tables. 

#### Measure Development Using DAX  

- Created key DAX measures for KPIs: Total Sales, Profit Margin, YoY Sales, ROI, Gross Profit, etc.
- Used calculated columns and measures to support visuals requiring trend analysis, comparisons, and percentage breakdowns.

    ##### Here are some of the Dax measures created to enrich the project insights

```DAX
% Return_Quantity = 
 DIVIDE(
    SUM(FactSales[ReturnQuantity]),
    SUM(FactSales[SalesQuantity]),
    0
)
```
```DAX
% Total_Cost = 
DIVIDE(
    SUM(FactSales[TotalCost]),
    SUM(FactSales[Sales]),
    0
)
```
```DAX
Profit Margin = 
DIVIDE(
    SUMX(FactSales, FactSales[Gross Profit]), 
    SUM(FactSales[Net Sales]), 
    0
)
```
```DAX
Profit Margin = 
DIVIDE(
    SUMX(FactSales, FactSales[Gross Profit]), 
    SUM(FactSales[Net Sales]), 
    0
)
```
```DAX
Profit Margin % by BrandName = 
DIVIDE(
    SUM(FactSales[Gross Profit]), 
    CALCULATE(SUM(FactSales[Net Sales]), ALL(DimProduct[BrandName])), 
    0
)
```
```DAX
Profit Margin % by Channel = 
DIVIDE(
    SUM(FactSales[Gross Profit]), 
    CALCULATE(SUM(FactSales[Net Sales]), ALL('DimChannel'[ChannelName])), 
    0
)
```
```DAX
Profit Margin % by Product = 
DIVIDE(
    SUM(FactSales[Gross Profit]), 
    CALCULATE(SUM(FactSales[Net Sales]), ALL('DimProductSubcategory'[ProductSubcategoryName])), 
    0
)
```
```DAX
YoY Catalog Store = 
VAR CurrentYear = MAX('Date'[Year])
VAR PreviousYr = CurrentYear - 1
VAR CurrentSales = 
    CALCULATE(
        SUM('FactSales'[Sales]),
        'Date'[Year] = CurrentYear,
        'DimChannel'[ChannelName] = "Catalog"
    )
VAR PreviousSales = 
    CALCULATE(
        SUM('FactSales'[Sales]),
        'Date'[Year]= PreviousYr,
        'DimChannel'[ChannelName] = "Catalog"
    )
RETURN 
    CurrentSales - PreviousSales
```
```DAX
YoY Catalog Store (%) = 
VAR CurrentYear = MAX('Date'[Year])
VAR PreviousYr = CurrentYear - 1
VAR CurrentSales = 
    CALCULATE(
        SUM('FactSales'[Sales]),
        'Date'[Year] = CurrentYear,
        'DimChannel'[ChannelName] = "Catalog"
    )
VAR PreviousSales = 
    CALCULATE(
        SUM('FactSales'[Sales]),
        'Date'[Year] = PreviousYr,
        'DimChannel'[ChannelName] = "Catalog"
    )
RETURN 
    IF(
        PreviousSales <> 0,
        DIVIDE(CurrentSales - PreviousSales, PreviousSales),
        BLANK()  // This handles the scenario where there are no previous year sales to compare against.
    )
```

#### Dashboard Design & Visualization

- Mockup Design
- Designed three themed dashboards in Power BI Desktop:
  - Executive Overview (sales trends & KPIs)
  - Channel & Brand Analysis
  - Profit Margin Analysis
- Incorporated slicers (e.g., Year, Channel, Product) for interactivity.
- Used best practices for visual hierarchy, color consistency, and user-friendly layout.

#### Publishing and Collaboration  
- Published the reports to Power BI Service for stakeholder access and automated refresh.
- Set up appropriate workspace permissions and dashboard sharing.

#### Documentation & Version Control  

- Documented the entire process including the model schema, DAX measures, and dashboard usage instructions.
- Uploaded final .pbix file, SQL scripts, and documentation to GitHub for version control and public portfolio presentation.

#### Review & Iteration  

- Collected feedback from stakeholders and refined visuals and measures accordingly.
- Monitored performance and usability, making adjustments to filters, visuals, and tooltips for clarity.
